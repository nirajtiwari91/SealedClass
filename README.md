A sealed class, in C#, isÂ a class that cannot be inherited by any class but can be instantiated.

We use sealed classes to prevent inheritance. As we cannot inherit a sealed class, the methods in the sealed class cannot be change from other classes.

For sealed class we use sealed keyword before class name.
